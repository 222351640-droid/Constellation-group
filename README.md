# AI-Powered Energy Theft and Leak Detection System

📌 Project Overview

This project introduces an AI solution to detect electricity theft and oil/gas pipeline leaks in the energy sector. The system uses machine learning for anomaly detection, deep learning for drone imagery analysis, and natural language processing for chatbot interaction. It supports municipalities and energy companies by reducing losses, improving safety, and enhancing service delivery in line with the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR).

🎯 Problem Statement

Energy theft and pipeline leaks cause billions in losses, frequent outages, and safety hazards in developing regions. Traditional monitoring systems are slow, reactive, and inefficient. This project provides a proactive AI-powered solution that automatically detects theft and leaks in real-time.


🎯 Objectives

Detect energy theft and pipeline leaks proactively using AI.
Support municipalities with accurate, real-time alerts.
Improve infrastructure safety and reduce operational costs.
Engage communities through an AI-powered chatbot.
